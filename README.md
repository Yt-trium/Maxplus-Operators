# Maxplus-Operators
This repository contains the code for the paper Max-plus Operators Applied to Filter Selection and Model Pruning in Neural Networks (Under review by International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology 2019). 

## Example Usage
This repository holds the code for a simple Max-plus model on MNIST dataset.
1. Train the base Max-plus model
```
python train.py
```
2. Evaluate the pruned Max-plus model
```
python eval.py
```
