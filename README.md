# Maxplus-Operators
This repository contains the code for reproducing the experiments in conference paper ```Max-plus Operators Applied to Filter Selection and Model Pruning in Neural Networks```, which is accepted by International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology 2019.

## Example Usage
A simple Max-plus model on MNIST dataset.
1. Train the base Max-plus model
```
python train.py
```
2. Evaluate the pruned Max-plus model
```
python eval.py
```
